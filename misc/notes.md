1. how to install deps in uv without requriements.txt?
> use => `uv sync` === pip install -r requirements.txt 
2. use `reload = True in 
3. for uuid4 in pydantic, just import `UUID4` from pydantic

## path parameters
- same bs that make the url dynamic like url params in express 
- syntax: app.get("/some-route/{some_var}")
    - use {variable_name} for dynamic shit
### path validation using `Path()` from fastapi
- use Path(min_val,max_val, ...) and other shit to validate what's within the url path: 
for eg: `localhost:3880/movies/{movies_id}
enforce those shit for url to behave strictly when taking url params
## query params
- When you declare other function parameters that are not part of the path parameters, they are automatically interpreted as "query" parameters.
- your typical `url.com?key=value` syntax

## POST
- send body using the `Body()` method . (import from fastapi module) 
- can use f strings in return statements like this: 

```python
return {
    "message": f"operation '{something}' done successfully!",
}
``` 

# pydantic
- create a request class upon the actual class, which is the request ka schema.
- then inherit the baseClass given by pydantic to that request class to use its validation features 
eg: Movie class will be as MovieRequest class or sum. 

ðŸ¤” **"Why use `model_dump()` if the incoming request is already JSON?"**
```python
@app.post("/create-movie")
def create_movie(movie_req: MovieRequest ):
    new_movies = Movie(**movie_req.model_dump()) 
```
- this `movie_req` thing is a model instance of PYDANTIC!! so it will look sum like tis: 
- new_movies = Movie(**movie_req.model_dump()) 
# Incoming raw JSON â†’ parsed by FastAPI
movies = MovieRequest(name="Inception", year=2010, director="Christopher Nolan")

### ðŸ§  FastAPI Automatically Converts This:

```python
# Incoming raw JSON â†’ parsed by FastAPI
movies = MovieRequest(name="Inception", year=2010, director="Christopher Nolan")
```

Now `movies` is **NOT a dictionary**, it's a **Pydantic model instance**, which behaves like:

```python
class MovieRequest(BaseModel):
    name: str
    year: int
    director: str
```

So this line:

```python
Movie(**movies)
```

ðŸ”´ **Will raise an error** like:

```
TypeError: type object argument after ** must be a mapping, not MovieRequest
```

Because `**movies` tries to unpack a model, which is not a dict.

## Field validation
- use the Field method to validate value in obj 
- eg: `Field(
            min_length=, 
            max_length=,
            gt=, 
            lt=
        )

## model config
- why use this? 
> it will help pre-populate the json for request to server
- use it inside the req class like this : 
```python
{
    "json_schema_extra": {
        "example": {
            "field": "value",
            "field2": "value2"
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

 - i can configure swagger docs to behave my way. eg i changed this in the fastapi instance
```python
app = FastAPI(swagger_ui_parameters={"tryItOutEnabled": True})
```
> why ? becuase it was annoying to click the "try it now" button time and again
